## Description
  
This application was designed to create professional README.md files given user input. The user will begin by running npm i to install any dependencies from the npm and then follow this action by running node index.js to run the program. The terminal will ask the user a series of questions that will populate a custom README.md file based on those answers. 

## Installation 

The application will require the additional use of npm's such as Inquirer and FS in order to run properly. These can be obtained by running npi install in the terminal. This will install the necessary dependencies.
